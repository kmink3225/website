    "text": "(Working on creating my website…)\n\nShort Introduction\nI am passionate and self-taught in statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and programming using open-source tools such as Python, R, SQL, and Airflow. It has been 7years to deal with data research from data modeling to data visualization through modeling.\n\n\nExperience\nMy educational background is a BS in biochemistry from South Korea, BA in mathematics in the U.S., and MS in biostatistics in the U.S. Since I have a strong background in biology, my career started in the medical realm of analytics. My work experience exposed me to an environment where I had to communicate with the laymen to understand data science to them.\n\n\nReason for Blogging in Data Science\n(Pursuing Goal in Data Science)\nSince I deal with data, SW developers, and non-professional coworkers, I have found myself needing more knowledge in mathematics, statistics, and IT to acquire skills in giving an easy, clear, and concise explanation for better communication. That’s why I decided to start blogging to have opportunities to convince myself of new skills in machine learning, not only with fundamental statistics."
