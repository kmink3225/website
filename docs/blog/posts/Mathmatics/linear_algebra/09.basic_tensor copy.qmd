## Tensor

A tensor is a mathematical object that generalizes vectors and matrices to higher dimensions. A tensor of order $n$ is an object that can be represented by a multidimensional array of $n$ indices. Each index can take on a range of values, which determine the dimensionality of the tensor along that axis.

For example, a rank-2 tensor (i.e., a matrix) can be represented as:

$$
\mathbf A_{ij} \text{ , } i=1,\dots m \text{, } j=1,\dots,n
$$
where $\mathbf A$ is the tensor, $i$ and $j$ are the indices, and $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of the tensor along each axis. The entries of the tensor are given by $a_{ij}$.

A rank-3 tensor can be represented as:
$$
\mathbf A_{ijk} \text{ , } i=1,\dots m \text{, } j=1,\dots,n\text{, } k=1,\dots,p
$$
where $\mathbf A$ is the tensor, $i$, $j$, and $k$ are the indices, and $m$, $n$, and $p$ are the dimensions of the tensor along each axis. The entries of the tensor are given by $A_{ijk}$.
