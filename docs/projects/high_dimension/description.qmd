# Introduction

## Background

Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a most common form of dementia that affects millions of Americans. AD affects memory, thinking and behavior, but its progression is slow, spanning nearly two decades before the symptoms appear. Thus, it is imperative to understand the physiology at the pre-clinical stage. It is estimated that genetic factors contribute nearly 50% to AD. To better understand how genes contribute to the risk of AD by altering cellular milieu, we have examined the metabolome of high risk individuals, the APOE4 carriers. The metabolome represents the products that were generated from the genome and proteome. These biochemical products represent influences of both genetic and environmental factors. In this article, I prepared simulated data to reproduce and demonstrate a rough analysis pipeline due to security concerns.

## Objective

The objective of the Long Life Family Study (LLFS) project was to build an analysis pipeline of identifying significant biomarkers for AD using statistics and machine learning at the multi stages from the genomic to the metabolomic stage through the transcriptomic and proteomic stage.

## Goal

In this simulation study, I will focus only on generating fake data at the metabolomic stage by generating data under multivariate normal distributions. The aim of this simulation study is to identify a set of predictors (or metabolites or bio-chemicals) that will enable to differentiate bio-markers that are associated with AD vs. non-AD.

## Feature

Due to security concerns, it is difficult to display the real data and the entire analysis pipeline used in this project. Therefore, I will generate fake data to reproduce and demonstrate a rough analysis pipeline through some simulation.
