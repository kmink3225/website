In longitudinal data analysis, the Cox proportional hazards model is commonly used to model time-to-event data while accounting for the correlation between observations within each subject. The Cox model assumes that the hazard function for an individual is proportional to a baseline hazard function and a set of covariates that are time-independent.

To estimate the coefficients of the Cox model in longitudinal data analysis, a common approach is to use the marginal Cox model or the Cox mixed-effects model. The marginal Cox model estimates the population-averaged effect of the covariates on the hazard function and ignores the within-subject correlation, whereas the Cox mixed-effects model incorporates random effects to model the within-subject correlation and estimate subject-specific hazard ratios.

To fit the Cox mixed-effects model, one can use the Cox mixed-effects function in software packages such as R, Stata, or SAS. The function takes as input the survival data, covariates, and a random effects term to model the within-subject correlation. The output of the function includes the estimated coefficients for the fixed effects, which represent the population-averaged effect of the covariates, and the estimated variance components for the random effects, which quantify the within-subject correlation.

It is important to note that the interpretation of the coefficients in the Cox mixed-effects model is different from the standard Cox model, as they represent subject-specific hazard ratios rather than population-averaged hazard ratios. Additionally, the Cox mixed-effects model assumes that the random effects follow a normal distribution, which may not be appropriate for all datasets.

Overall, estimating the coefficients of the Cox proportional hazards model in longitudinal data analysis requires fitting a mixed-effects model that accounts for the within-subject correlation, and the choice of model depends on the research question and assumptions of the data.


When analyzing family data using the Cox proportional hazards model, there are two common approaches: the shared frailty model and the stratified Cox model.

The shared frailty model assumes that there is a random effect or frailty that is shared among individuals within a family, which accounts for the correlation between individuals in the same family. The frailty can be interpreted as a common genetic or environmental factor that affects the risk of the event. The shared frailty model estimates the population-averaged hazard ratios for the covariates, while incorporating the within-family correlation.

The stratified Cox model, on the other hand, assumes that the hazard ratios for the covariates are the same within each family, but can differ between families. The stratified Cox model stratifies the data by family and estimates separate hazard functions for each family. The stratified Cox model estimates the subject-specific hazard ratios for the covariates, while accounting for the within-family correlation.

The choice between the shared frailty model and the stratified Cox model depends on the research question and assumptions of the data. The shared frailty model may be appropriate when there is a shared factor that affects the risk of the event within families, while the stratified Cox model may be appropriate when there are differences in the hazard ratios between families.

Both approaches can be implemented using software packages such as R, SAS, or Stata, which have functions for fitting Cox proportional hazards models with random effects or stratification. It is important to appropriately model the within-family correlation when analyzing family data to avoid biased or inefficient estimates.
