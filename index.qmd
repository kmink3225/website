(Working on creating my website...)

### Short Introduction

I am passionate and self-taught in statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and programming using open-source tools such as Python, R, SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, MS SQL), and Airflow. It has been 7years to deal with data research from data modeling to data visualization through modeling.

### Experience

My educational background is a BS in biochemistry from South Korea, BA in mathematics in the U.S., and MS in biostatistics in the U.S. Since I have a strong background in biology, my career started in the medical realm of analytics. My work experience exposed me to an environment where I had to communicate with the laymen to understand data science to them.

### Reason of Blogging in Data Science

(Pursuing Goal in Data Science)

Since I deal with data, SW developers, and non-professional coworkers, I have found myself needing more knowledge in mathematics, statistics, and IT to acquire skills in giving an easy, clear, and concise explanation for better communication. That's why I decided to start blogging to have opportunities to convince myself of new skills in machine learning, not only with fundamental statistics.
